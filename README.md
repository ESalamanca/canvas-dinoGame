# Making a Mario-type Game with Canvas

This project was made for my Ironhack Game project. The idea was to create a super mario bros type game in 2d  with canvas. This is a super simplified version with sprites, animations, collision detection... 

The game can be played at  [here](https://esalamanca.github.io/canvas-dinoGame/). The game is wrapped into a [game bootstrap](https://github.com/ESalamanca/canvas-dinoGame) project that you can use to quickly get started. I recommend checking out the source code. It can run locally by opening `index.html`.

## JS Libraries

I essentially used basic javascript with the possibilities offered by the [Canvas html tag](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html)

To handle the loading of images, I used the PreloadJS library from the [CreateJS](https://www.createjs.com/) suite. The code is in the `ressources.js`file. 

## Using free graphics 

There are many websites that offer free game assets. I found almost all I needed on www.gameart2d.com. You can the create your own sprites with online tools such as https://www.codeandweb.com/free-sprite-sheet-packer.
